# DS Helper Team: GSEA

In this session we are going to reproduce what it is the study of different cell populations through linear models and GSEA. To follow the session your need the GSEA software and R properly configured. It is shown below the R requirements to sucessfully run the code and the link to the GSEA software to install.

## R requirements

The requirements stated below work with R 4.0.5 and the matrix product libraries BLAS and LAPACK. You can study the loaded packages with the command sessionInfo().

- qusage == 2.24.0
- data.table == 1.14.0
- limma == 3.46.0
- biomaRt == 2.46.3
- ggrepel == 0.9.1
- oligo == 1.54.1
- stringr == 1.4.0
- dplyr == 1.0.5
- ggplot2 == 3.3.3

## GSEA

The software used to perform the analysis can be downloaded here:

## Additional notes

- **All the files** to conduct the analysis are already in the **repository** folders and can be generated with the code. 
- The code in the **notebook** is the same as the one in main.R, so **it is not needed** to conduct the analysis.
