# DS Helper Team: GSEA

In this session we are going to reproduce the study of different cell populations through GSEA. To follow the session you will need the GSEA software and R properly configured. The analysis has been conducted with the configuration described below, however, other configurations might work as well.

## R requirements

The requirements stated below work with R 4.0.5 and the matrix product libraries BLAS and LAPACK (usually installed by default). You can study the loaded packages with the R command *sessionInfo()*.

- qusage == 2.24.0
- data.table == 1.14.0
- limma == 3.46.0
- biomaRt == 2.46.3
- ggrepel == 0.9.1
- oligo == 1.54.1
- stringr == 1.4.0
- dplyr == 1.0.5
- ggplot2 == 3.3.3

## GSEA

The software used to perform the analysis can be downloaded here:

## Additional notes

- **All the files** to conduct the analysis are already in the **repository** folders and can be generated with the code. 
- The code in the **notebook** is the same as the one in main.R, so **the notebook is not needed** to conduct the analysis.
